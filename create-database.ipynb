Instructors will notifystudents of any changes and students will be responsible for abiding them. Even if you print thissyllabus, please check the online version often.\\nDescription\\nIST 412: The Engineering of Complex Software Systems (3 credits per semester/maximum of 3) -\\nIntroduction to the engineering of complex software systems including software system specification,design and implementation, integration and test, and evolution.\\nThis course presents the fundamental concepts of the engineering of complex software systems,including iterative and agile development strategies. The course gives students insight into the fullsoftware development cycle, including design, implementation, test and quality assurance, deployment,maintenance, and project estimation and management.\\nIST 412\\nis an elective course for theBaccalaureate degree program in Information Sciences and Technology. Students completing theSystems Development Option may take this course to fulfill option requirements. Upon completion of thiscourse, students will have a broad understanding of the fundamental concepts of complex systemsoftware engineering and be able to apply these concepts to managing and developing a complexsoftware project over the full software development cycle.\\nPrerequisites\\nIST 311 with a C or better\\nObjectives\\nAt the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\\nUnderstand and explain the critical issues in complex software development.\\nUnderstand, explain, and use software development lifecycle models including waterfall, spiral, andagile methods.\\nElicit software requirements from stakeholders; run a basic user study; specify, validate, and prioritizefunctional, non-functional, and user interaction requirements.\\nTranslate software requirements into an object-oriented system design\\nUnderstand and use test-driven development, including JUnit.\\nUnderstand and use basic project management techniques to control the software developmentprocess.\\nUnderstand and use basic software estimation techniques.\\n2/2/24, 10:52 AM Syllabus for IST 412, Section 001: Cmplx Soft Sys (22411--UP---P-IST-----412-------001-)\\nhttps://psu.instructure.com/courses/2312044/assignments/syllabus 2/12\\nUnderstand and use basic project risk management techniques.\\nUnderstand and use system architecture and design patterns.\\nUnderstand and use professional software development practices such as refactoring, softwarecoding styles, design-by-contract, and others.\\nUnderstand and use modern software deployment strategies.\\nInstructor\\nUrja Vora (Office Hours: Every Friday in the time-slot of 1:30pm - 2:30pm at my office, E397D inWestgate Building or by appointment)\\nLA / TA\\nYue You (yxy340@psu.edu)\\nSarah Ricupero (\\nskr5576@psu.edu (mailto:skr5576@psu.edu)\\n)\\nMaterials\\nYou are responsible for all the readings, even if material is not covered explicitly in a lesson. Takingnotes on the material you are reading and reflecting on both the reading and these notes will help you tounderstand better the issues, concepts, and techniques that are being presented.\\nWe will be using primarily electronic texts.\\nCourse Tools\\nThe course will make use of several different tools including an Integrated Development Environment(IDE), software modeling and design applications, and other online resources.\\nSpecific instructions for specific tools will be posted to the Canvas Unit where related activities anddeliverables appear.\\nJava Development\\nYou will be using an Integrated Development Environment, preferably Intellij IDEA, for all projectdevelopment work.\\nTo install IntelliJ IDEA use portal of Jet Brains. The installation is describedat\\nhttps://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)\\nfor eachplatform and includes a bundled java version. While the functionality included in the Community Editionis sufficient to some extent, I recommend that you register an account and claim the free academiclicense for the Ultimate version. Jet Brains has a lot of excellent, professional-quality tools that arepopular among professional developers.\\n2/2/24, 10:52 AM Syllabus for IST 412, Section 001: Cmplx Soft Sys (22411--UP---P-IST-----412-------001-)\\nhttps://psu.instructure.com/courses/2312044/assignments/syllabus 3/12\\nWith any source code submission make sure to include a README.txt file detailing any usernames andpasswords required to log in to the app. You generally should not use external libraries but if you domake sure they are included as part of the project. If the project does not build and run you will receive azero for the assignment.\\nConceptual Design\\nYou will be using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for part of your conceptual design. There areseveral software tools available for constructing UML models.\\nYou may choose to use the MS Visio application, which is available through\\nvLabs\\n(https://www.up.ist.psu.edu/vlabs)\\n. The course lessons generally use MS Visio for UML demonstrations\\n.\\nYou can also install MS Visio on your own computer through the\\nPenn State Dreamspark program.\\n(https://www.up.ist.psu.edu/dreamspark/access.php)\\nAn open source and free tool you can use to create your UML diagrams is\\nArgoUML (https://argoumltigris-\\norg.github.io/tigris/argouml/)\\n.\\nFinally, you may also choose to use an online tool for creating your UML models. One that has beentested and is recommended for the course is\\ndraw.io (https://www.draw.io/)\\n.\\nYou can use any UML modeling tool you like as long as it will produce a figure or file that can be insertedinto your MS Word document.\\nAssignments & Grading\\nThe course will follow an active, problem-based approach to learning. There is a longer-term groupproject that will provide the opportunity to gain practice with new concepts and skills, and develop anddemonstrate a solid understanding of the course material.\\nCourse Project:\\nThe main course project will consist of design and development of a complexsoftware system. Participation in the group project involves both individual efforts and groupcollaboration. You will work on the project exercises in groups of four to six.
