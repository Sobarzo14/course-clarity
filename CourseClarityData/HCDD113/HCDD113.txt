HCDD 113 provides a rigorous introduction to the theories, models, and tools that inform Human-Centered Design and Development. It lays the groundwork for subsequent courses in the sequence by examining the relationship between physical capabilities, cognitive and social models, and philosophical issues pertinent to human-centered analysis, design and development work. The course is practice-based, which means that it instructs more abstract concepts through practical activities and practice-based inquiry. Students will learn how to apply cognitive models and philosophical concepts to real-world problems. This approach has the dual benefit of (1) highly engaging pedagogy and (2) the production of portfolio-quality deliverables that students will be able to use to secure internships and entry-level positions in industry. Students will gain skills for synthesizing and communicating design implications as well as presenting work in multiple contexts (e.g. live presentations vs. bite-sized portfolio pages). The format of the class will balance project work with tests, quizzes, short essays, and discussions on key topics. It will also include readings and some short lectures.
