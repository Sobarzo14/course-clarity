This course focuses on concepts, methods, and techniques for studying users and evaluating technology in the context of use. It will provide students with methods and tools they can use to incorporate knowledge of users and their settings into the design and evaluation of interactive systems. These methods will include both qualitative and quantitative techniques, as well as how to combine and sequence multiple techniques to gain a more holistic understanding. Students will learn to select and use appropriate data gathering and analysis methods and how to assemble these into a coherent user research design. The course also provides an overview of the most important statistical analysis methods employed in user research. This is a hands-on, practical course designed for HCDD undergraduate students, and others as an elective.
