This course focuses on concepts, methods, techniques, and tools for designing effective technology-enabled experiences. The course will provide students with all the elements for a toolbox they can use to design and create both prototypes and working applications, and some analytic methods they can use to perform basic evaluations. The course will emphasize iterative design and the benefits of employing a cycle of analyze - design - built - evaluate in close cooperation with prospective technology users and other product stakeholders. In addition to more practice-oriented skills and knowledge, the course will provide students with an appreciation for some persistent design challenges including managing design trade-offs, ensuring universal and international access, working with others on co-design, and receiving and delivering design critiques. Students who successfully complete the course will leave equipped to engage with practicing design teams in industry, government, and academia.
