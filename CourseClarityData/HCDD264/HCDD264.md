## Description
This course focuses on concepts, methods, techniques, and tools for designing effective technology-enabled experiences. The course will provide studentswith all the elements for a toolbox they can use to design and create both prototypes and working applications, and some analytic methods they can use toperform basic evaluations. The course will emphasize iterative design and the benefits of employing a cycle of analyze – design – built – evaluate in closecooperation with prospective technology users and other product stakeholders.
In addition to more practice-oriented skills and knowledge, the course will provide students with an appreciation for some persistent design challengesincluding managing design trade-offs, ensuring universal and international access, working with others on co-design, and receiving and delivering designcritiques. Students who successfully complete the course will leave equipped to engage with practicing design teams in industry, government, and academia.
Prerequisites
HCDD 113
Objectives
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
Explain the importance of iterative, human-centered design in creating useful and usable technology products.
Analyze and structure design problems.
Apply a number of established design concepts, methods, techniques, and tools to experience design problems at scale.
Apply basic analytic evaluation methods to both design representations, and the prototypes and working technologies resulting from their design work.
Explain some of the special challenges that emerge from design in groups and within large organizations.
Appreciate and address challenges that arise from the need for universal and international access to technology.

In Canvas and online, posted as assigned.
Assignments & Grading
The course will follow an active, problem-based approach to learning. Quizzes, essays and other homework assignments, and group design activities willprovide the opportunity to gain practice with new concepts and skills, and develop and demonstrate a solid understanding of the course material.
Quizzes
About five (5) quizzes will be given over the course of the semester to encourage your ongoing attention to course material. Covered topics will be drawnlargely from assigned readings, but all other lecture content and supplementary readings are also fair game.
Individual & Group Activities
Homework activities are assigned and reviewed regularly. Many of these will be design activities where you practice putting to use one or more of thetechniques learned in class and through readings. The purpose of many homework assignments is often to encourage you to explore material
before
it isdiscussed in class. Homework assignments are marked with an emphasis on effort and completeness. Many homework assignments are for paired work butnote that this will be specified for each assignment, assume that you are to complete assignments on your own, individually, unless explicit in theassignment.
Course Project
The course project will consist of analysis and design of several interactive application concepts. You will work on the project exercises in groups of two orthree. The instructor will assign group membership during the first few weeks of class. The purpose of this project is to give you hands-on, in-depthexperience with a wide range of object-oriented design and development activities.
Group Work
Grading will be based on the assignment for the work submitted. Individuals can have their grade adjusted lower from the team grade based upon theperformance of the members in the group. Submitted work should include the names of the members who contributed to the submission. If the member didnot contribute, then please leave their name off the work submitted. If the member did not fully complete the work they said they would do or missed a teamdeadline, the team can submit a % (percentage) of what the person did for their grade to be adjusted.
Grading Criteria
In general, assignments will be graded based on the following general criteria:
Correctness (e.g. concepts, techniques, and tools are used appropriately)
Completeness (e.g. written work address all aspects of the problem as described in the assignment specification.)
Clarity (e.g. written work and diagrams are free of typographical and grammatical errors, and are formatted neatly)

Academic Integrity/Plagiarism/Cheating:
We live in a time of great risk for plagiarism: It is so easy to copy digital materials that people sometimes do itwithout thinking much about what they are doing - for example, copying digital music or programs. You might be reading a digital document, and copy outsome of the text just intending to "take notes" on interesting concepts. Yet those digital notes, if they find their way into your papers, are plagiarism. Whenyou are a professional in the working world, this is the kind of mistake that be career-ending. So it is important to train yourself, and develop scholarlypractices that make it impossible for you to plagiarize.
The simplest way to avoid plagiarism is to document the sources of your information carefully. If you have any doubts about what plagiarism is please clearthem up. There are many resources at Penn State and on the Internet for this (e.g.,
http://www.indiana.edu/~istd/test.html
(http://www.indiana.edu/~istd/test.html)
). If you have doubts about your own texts, consider checking them with Turnitin or other plagiarism detection services(
http://tlt.its.psu.edu/turnitin/ (http://tlt.its.psu.edu/turnitin/)
). We need to have zero tolerance for plagiarism. In this class, we will follow the standardPenn State protocol for dealing with suspected plagiarism (
http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html
(http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html)
).
The Penn State Principles and University Code of Conduct take a clear and hard line on academic integrity:
"Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest,and responsible manner. In according with the University’s Code of Conduct, you must not engage in or tolerate academic dishonesty. This includes, but isnot limited to cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession ofexaminations, submitting work of another person, or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of otherstudents."
Any violation of academic integrity will be investigated, and where warranted, punitive action will be taken. For every incident when a penalty of any kind isassessed, a report must be filed.
Americans with Disabilities Act:
The College of Information Sciences and Technology welcomes persons with disabilities to all of its classes, programs,and events. If you need accommodations, or have questions about access to buildings where IST activities are held, please contact us in advance of yourparticipation or visit. If you need assistance during a class, program, or event, please contact the member of our staff or faculty in charge. Access to ISTcourses should be arranged by contacting the Office of the Dean, 332G Information Sciences and Technology Building, (814) 865-4461.
An Invitation to Students with Learning Disabilities:
It is Penn State’s policy to not discriminate against qualified students with documented disabilities inits educational programs. (You may refer to the Nondiscrimination Policy in the Student Guide to University Policies and Rules.) If you have a disability-related need for reasonable academic adjustments in this course, contact the Office for Disability Services (ODS) at 814-863-1807 (V/TTY).
