Description
HCDD 440: Human-Centered Capstone (3 credits)
The Human-Centered Design and Development Capstone course develops the research orientation andcreative problem-solving necessary for successful careers. The capstone develops these skills in thecontext of a semester-long project, the solution to which requires the integration of knowledge, skills, andanalytic techniques taught in the core curriculum. The capstone will also give students real-worldexperience in which they will need to work in teams and will be coached on ways to translate analyticoutcomes into meaningful and actionable information for decision-makers.
The course is intended for seniors who have completed the core courses. The capstone projects willintegrate knowledge gained in technical subjects such as usability engineering, software constructionand engineering, and mobile computing as well as general information technology topics such asmachine learning, data mining, data integration and visualization, and privacy and security. Students willalso hone their presentation and technical writing skills, generating effective reports that not only explaintheir analytic processes, and assumptions underlying the processes and outcomes but alsocommunicate the limitations of their approach and potential alternate strategies.
Prerequisites
IST 261 or IST 361
HCDD 340 (recommended)
HCDD 364W
Objectives
Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:
Use systems theory to analyze real-world challenges of people, software, and hardware.
Formulate a problem description to communicate with different stakeholders.
Identify how human-centered approaches can inspire technology design.
Develop and evaluate a socio-technological solution to a real-world problem.

Course Structure
The goal is to give students maximum creative freedom—the freedom to choose their own work toshowcase in their portfolio before graduation.
There won't be any traditional lectures, quizzes, midterms, or final exams. Instead,
We'll set five milestones
with well-defined rubrics (see below)
for each team to meet.
The instructor will
act as a manager, assist
each team in defining the
scope, and
set theexpectations for
each team
.
The TAs will act as the shadow group member for each team.
Students must work in groups of two to four.
Single-person groups or group sizes over 4 will need special consideration.
Since teamwork is crucial for capstone projects, we will designate Tuesdays as a "group work" dayfor students to brainstorm and collaborate during class time.
We'll propose some interesting project ideas, but students are also free to come up with their own.
Mandatory
Attendance
At most 3 classes can be missed without penalty (
students must inform team members and theinstructor in advance)
