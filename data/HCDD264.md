## Description

This course focuses on concepts, methods, techniques, and tools for designing effective technology-enabled experiences. The course will provide studentswith all the elements for a toolbox they can use to design and create both prototypes and working applications, and some analytic methods they can use toperform basic evaluations. The course will emphasize iterative design and the benefits of employing a cycle of analyze – design – built – evaluate in closecooperation with prospective technology users and other product stakeholders.
In addition to more practice-oriented skills and knowledge, the course will provide students with an appreciation for some persistent design challengesincluding managing design trade-offs, ensuring universal and international access, working with others on co-design, and receiving and delivering designcritiques. Students who successfully complete the course will leave equipped to engage with practicing design teams in industry, government, and academia.

## Prerequisites

HCDD 113

## Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
Explain the importance of iterative, human-centered design in creating useful and usable technology products.
Analyze and structure design problems.
Apply a number of established design concepts, methods, techniques, and tools to experience design problems at scale.
Apply basic analytic evaluation methods to both design representations, and the prototypes and working technologies resulting from their design work.
Explain some of the special challenges that emerge from design in groups and within large organizations.
Appreciate and address challenges that arise from the need for universal and international access to technology.

## Assignments & Grading

The course will follow an active, problem-based approach to learning. Quizzes, essays and other homework assignments, and group design activities willprovide the opportunity to gain practice with new concepts and skills, and develop and demonstrate a solid understanding of the course material.

### Quizzes

About five (5) quizzes will be given over the course of the semester to encourage your ongoing attention to course material. Covered topics will be drawnlargely from assigned readings, but all other lecture content and supplementary readings are also fair game.

### Individual & Group Activities

Homework activities are assigned and reviewed regularly. Many of these will be design activities where you practice putting to use one or more of thetechniques learned in class and through readings. The purpose of many homework assignments is often to encourage you to explore material
before
it isdiscussed in class. Homework assignments are marked with an emphasis on effort and completeness. Many homework assignments are for paired work butnote that this will be specified for each assignment, assume that you are to complete assignments on your own, individually, unless explicit in theassignment.

### Course Project

The course project will consist of analysis and design of several interactive application concepts. You will work on the project exercises in groups of two orthree. The instructor will assign group membership during the first few weeks of class. The purpose of this project is to give you hands-on, in-depthexperience with a wide range of object-oriented design and development activities.

### Group Work

Grading will be based on the assignment for the work submitted. Individuals can have their grade adjusted lower from the team grade based upon theperformance of the members in the group. Submitted work should include the names of the members who contributed to the submission. If the member didnot contribute, then please leave their name off the work submitted. If the member did not fully complete the work they said they would do or missed a teamdeadline, the team can submit a % (percentage) of what the person did for their grade to be adjusted.

### Grading Criteria

In general, assignments will be graded based on the following general criteria:
Correctness (e.g. concepts, techniques, and tools are used appropriately)
Completeness (e.g. written work address all aspects of the problem as described in the assignment specification.)
Clarity (e.g. written work and diagrams are free of typographical and grammatical errors, and are formatted neatly)

Students can get obtain peer tutoring at Penn State Learning in twolocations: 220 Boucke Bldg. and 113 Pattee Library (Reserve Reading Room). Peer tutors read constructively; listen actively; ask questions about therhetorical situation; discuss matters such as unity, coherence, development, style, and mechanics; and offer encouragement to help students improve aswriters. Students wishing to schedule appointments or ask questions about drop-in tutorials may speak with a receptionist at 814-865-1841 orvisit
