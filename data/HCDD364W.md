Explain the importance of multi-method user research (triangulation).Select and use appropriate user research data analysis methods.Explain the central challenges to effective technology evaluation.Write and present good user research/evaluation reports.
Readings
The course aims to provide an in-depth coverage of core user research and user experience (UX) evaluation methods. Thus, most weekshave a set of assigned readings, available on Canvas. Some readings are required; some readings are optional. Students are encouragedto read these readings to learn more about the methods beyond what our lectures afford to cover. It is not possible to cover all user research and evaluation methodologies in the time range of one semester. The best researchers I knowall study research methods and collect them, regardless of whether or not they might ever use them. So we will be using the Expandedand Revised edition of Universal Methods of Design to explore additional methods that we won't have time to use in class. This book isavailable at Amazon here:

Individual Assignments (50%) – There will six individual assignments to help you practice and master specific user research andevaluation methods. All assignments should be conducted independently unless otherwise stated by the instructor. Detailed assignmentdescriptions and rubrics will be posted on Canvas. You will be given sufficient time for assignment completion. Some of the individualassignments will feed into your group deliverables.
Group Project Deliverables (47%) – The course will provide hands-on experience. Students will form teams (4-5 students per team).Teams will be asked to select a domain of design, conduct a variety of user research, design a high-fi prototype, conduct user experienceevaluation activities on the prototype, and revise the prototype based on the evaluation insights.You can find each deliverable's guidelines in its description on Canvas. A grading rubric will be provided for all the individual assignments and group project deliverables. Note that, the following group projectdeliverables have special requirements in terms of format:G2. Comprehensive User Research Report G4. Comprehensive Usability Testing ReportG6. Final Presentation These three reports should be produced using industry-standard software such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Apple Keynote.You will need to submit your reports to Canvas (Please covert your slides to Pdf when submitting, otherwise Canvas may mess up yourslides’ fonts and design layouts). Detailed instruction and examples will be explained in class and posted on Canvas for you.The final presentation consists of a report and an in-class oral presentation on the report. Your final presentation will be graded on the following criteria:Structure & OrganizationStory & FlowMethods MasteryDesign & ProfessionalismDetailed rubrics are provided for all the assignments. The descriptions for each grade range, along with the feedback, should give you aclear understanding of your grade and provide you with valuable feedback.
Instructor Discretion (3%) – The instructor reserves 3% of the grade to be assigned at their discretion based on: i) reviews from othergroup members, and ii) their perception of a student engagement and learning effort over the course (attendance+in-class participation).Regarding i) reviews from other group members, we expect that all group members participate equally in each deliverable. At the end ofthe semester, you will be asked to provide a textual description of your teammates' contributions to the project. For each of your teammembers, you can highlight things such as whether the communication has been smooth, whether the individual tasks have beenperformed on time, whether the quality of their contribution met team needs, etc. Still, learning how to work effectively as a group is one ofthe learning objectives, and it is your shared responsibility to make sure that everyone does their fair share of work.
Extra Credits (1pt in Total)
There will be one opportunity to earn extra credit by providing peer feedback on other peer groups’ final presentations. Students whichprovide detailed, well-written, professional thought feedback will receive full, extra credit (1.0 pt or 1%); Students who complete a responsebut do so in a manner that lacks detail and insightful thought will receive partial credit (0.5 pt); Students who do not post a response willreceive no credit (0.0 pt).

Course Policy
Grading Policy
It is important to understand that your final letter grades reflect academic achievement and not effort. A plus or minus further delineatesrankings within these grade ranges.To have work re-graded, you must submit a Re-grade Request within one week of when your work was returned. The request must be asingle page, printed on paper or sent by e-mail to both the TA and instructor. It should contain the following information:Re-grade Request
2/15/24, 3:36 PM HCDD 364W, Section 001: METHOD USERS (22411--UP---P-HCDD----364W------001-)
https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2313029 7/10
The information contained on the standard cover sheet, including your name, PSU ID, assignment no.An explanation for why you believe you deserve a higher grade.The instructor and TA will consider your request. If the instructor and TA are convinced by your argument, your work will be re-graded. Ifnot, the instructor and/or TA will send you an e-mail explaining why. No re-grades will be considered for late work. Keep in mind that areview of the grading might also bring to light that the work was originally graded too generously; therefore, the grade couldconceivably be lowered. No grades will be lowered, however, simply because you challenged them.
Mistakes in the arithmetic computation of grades and grade recording errors will always be corrected. In all other situations, finalletter grades are not negotiable and challenges to final letter grades are not entertained.Late-Assignments 
It is your responsibility to turn in all requirements by the specified due dates and times in the Course Calendar. Ten percentage-points willbe deducted for every day you are late with an assignment or project (e.g., if the total score for the assignment is 20 points, 2 point will bededucted for each day it is late). Assignments submitted two days after the deadline will NOT be graded.
Canvas for Course Management Tool
This course uses Canvas as a main course management tool. Announcements and course materials will be posted in the Canvas coursesite. All of your assignments will be submitted on the Canvas course site as well. You are also responsible for keeping track of your gradesvia the gradebook on the main course site and for informing your instructor and TA in case there are any discrepancies.
Communication Policy 
Canvas email feature should be your official tool for communication with the instructor and TA. When sending emails, make sure you writepolitely and professionally and include the instructor and TA as recipients. Instructor, and TA will get it back to you within 24 hours duringonly weekdays (between 9am-5pm EST, Monday through Friday).  However, we will not respond to your email if it’s about gradegrubbing (see: https://marktomforde.com/academic/undergraduates/GradeGrubbing.html
(https://marktomforde.com/academic/undergraduates/GradeGrubbing.html) ).
AttendanceRecording Attendance: Attendance will be recorded from the second week onward at every class session.
Importance of Attendance: Consistent attendance is vital to grasp and build upon the skills and knowledge imparted during thecourse. Active participation enhances understanding and is integral to academic success.
Grading: Attendance and in-class participation are valuable components of your grade. The instructor will assign grades for theseaspects at their discretion.
Absences Due to Illness: If you are unable to attend due to illness, please email both the instructor and the teaching assistant with adoctor's note as soon as possible.
Checking In: Should you miss a class, the instructor or teaching assistant may reach out to ensure your well-being and to provide anymissed information.Remember, being present and engaged not only benefits your academic progress but also enriches the learning environment for all.
Collegial Courtesy/Technology Policy
Electronic devices brought to class which are used for purposes other than engaging with the course can distract both the instructor andyour classmates.  Imagine how you would feel if you had worked very hard on a presentation and your audience looked as though theyweren’t paying attention because they had their heads down looking at an electronic device; or, imagine coming to me during office hoursand I was texting while you were asking for my assistance.  Research in neurobiology indicates that people cannot multi-task or learn wellwhile trying to do so.Thus, we ask that when class is in session, you show courtesy to your classmates and instructor by not using the electronic devices unlessit is part of the course content for the day. Doing your email, going on Facebook, playing games, or any other non-class-related activity isdisrespectful of your classmates and the instructor. We will explicitly ask you to close your computers and put away your phones. Also,please put your mobile phone in your bags. If you absolutely must use your phone, please take it into the hallway.
