Course Description:
HCDD 113 provides a rigorous introduction to the theories, models, and tools that informHuman-Centered Design and Development. It lays the groundwork for subsequent courses in the sequence byexamining the relationship between physical capabilities, cognitive and social models, and philosophical issuespertinent to human-centered analysis, design and development work. The course is practice-based, whichmeans that it instructs more abstract concepts through practical activities and practice-based inquiry. Studentswill learn how to apply cognitive models and philosophical concepts to real-world problems. This approach hasthe dual benefit of (1) highly engaging pedagogy and (2) the production of portfolio-quality deliverables thatstudents will be able to use to secure internships and entry-level positions in industry. Students will gain skillsfor synthesizing and communicating design implications as well as presenting work in multiple contexts (e.g.live presentations vs. bite-sized portfolio pages). The format of the class will balance project work with tests,quizzes, short essays, and discussions on key topics. It will also include readings and some short lectures.(from the
Penn State Bulletin
).
Laptop Pilot:
This section of IST 113 requires you to bring your laptop to class every day.
Learning Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
Describe a condensed history of human-centered design & development, human-computer interaction, anduser experience design

Apply knowledge of physical abilities to real-world design projects
Explain and apply key cognitive models to real-world design projects
Explain and apply key social models to real-world design projects

Assignments and Grading:
The course will follow an active, problem-based approach to learning. Quizzes,essays and other homework assignments, group activities, and the final exam will provide the opportunity togain practice with new concepts and skills and develop and demonstrate understanding of the course material.
Quizzes -
About five (5) quizzes will be given over the course of the semester to encourage your ongoingattention to course material. Covered topics will be drawn largely from assigned readings, but all otherlecture content and supplementary readings are also fair game.
Activities -
Homework activities are assigned and reviewed regularly. Some of these will be short, reflectivewriting assignments, and others will involve applying the HCDD methods you will learn as part of the course.The purpose of many homework assignments is to encourage you to explore material
before
it is discussedin class. Homework assignments are marked with an emphasis on effort, quality, and completeness. Thoughsome assignments are for group work (see course project below), note that this will be specified for eachassignment, and you should assume assignments are to be completed on your own, individually, unlessexplicit in the assignment.
Course Project -
The course project will consist of analysis and design of an interactive applicationconcept. You will work on the project exercises in groups of three-four. The instructor will assign groupmembership during the first few weeks of class. The purpose of this project is to give you hands-on, in-depth experience with a wide range of methods in human-centered design & development.
Final Exam -
The final exam will be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the course. The final week ofclass will include an in-depth review session to explain what to expect on the exam.
In general, assignments will be graded based on the following general criteria:
Correctness (e.g. concepts, techniques, and tools are used appropriately)
Completeness (e.g. written work address all aspects of the problem as described in the assignmentspecification.)
Clarity (e.g. written work and diagrams are free of typographical and grammatical errors, and are formattedneatly)

Course Policies:
Attendance:
All students are expected to attend and participate in-person on the course's scheduled daysand times. Very often class will include some activity or assignment for credit. You MUST inform theinstructor in advance if you will miss class for some legitimate reason. Prior notification of an absence isrequired to be eligible for make-up work up to a maximum of three (3) absences in the semester.
Late Submissions:
All work
must be completed and turned in before the due date and time
.
Assignments submitted
late are deducted 25% for each 24 hours period after the due date and time i.emax 75% within 24 hours of the due date and time, max 50% within the next 24 hours, and so on.
There are no exceptions to the late submission policy.
Questions about grading -
All questions regarding grading must be resolved within
one week
ofassignment of a grade.
Logging into Canvas -
Students are expected to login regularly to check for course updates,announcements, emails, discussions, etc.
Updates will occur regularly so please make sure to keep up with announcements and updates to thecourse site.
Emailing through Canvas
- Students are expected to use Canvas for all course email communication.
Attending virtual meetings
- Students are expected to use specified virtual meeting tool(s) forcollaboration, meetings, presentations, etc., as needed.
Use of AI:
In this course, it is inappropriate to use AI tools in the development of responses, answers, and anycode that may be submitted on homework assignments, lab activities, projects, and examinations. Why? Thiscourse teaches foundational skills. Employers expect that internship and job applicants will be able to answerquestions about—and even solve a problem using—foundational skills, without using AI tools in the interview.Furthermore, to successfully use AI tools in the future, you need to know enough about the subject matter todiscern whether the AI output is correct.
The teaching team will evaluate your work to ensure that it has not been generated by an AI tool. Additionally, Imay ask you to explain the submission that you have created. Inability to present and defend one’s submissionmay be used as evidence in an Academic Integrity filing.

Academic Integrity/Plagiarism/Cheating:
We live in a time of great risk for plagiarism: It is so easy to copydigital materials that people sometimes do it without thinking much about what they are doing - for example,copying digital music or programs. You might be reading a digital document, and copy out some of the text justintending to "take notes" on interesting concepts. Yet those digital notes, if they find their way into your papers,are plagiarism. When you are a professional in the working world, this is the kind of mistake that be career-ending. It is important to train yourself and develop scholarly practices that make it impossible for you toplagiarize.
The simplest way to avoid plagiarism is to document the sources of your information carefully. If you have anydoubts about what plagiarism is, please clear them up. There are many resources at Penn State and on theInternet for this (e.g.,
http://www.indiana.edu/~istd/test.html (http://www.indiana.edu/%7Eistd/test.html)
). Ifyou have doubts about your own texts, consider checking them with Turnitin or other plagiarism detectionservices (
http://tlt.its.psu.edu/turnitin/ (http://tlt.its.psu.edu/turnitin/)
). We need to have zero tolerance forplagiarism. In this class, we will follow the standard Penn State protocol for dealing with suspected plagiarism(
http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html (http://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-
academic-integrity.html)
).
The Penn State Principles and University Code of Conduct take a clear and hard line on academic integrity:
"Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at Penn State University, allowing thepursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest, and responsible manner.

This includes, but is not limited tocheating, plagiarism, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others,unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person, or work previously used withoutinforming the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students."
Any violation of academic integrity will be investigated, and where warranted, punitive action will be taken. Forevery incident when a penalty of any kind is assessed, a report must be filed.
